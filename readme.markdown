# Themes made of *Awesome* with SASS and Compass

This repo contains code examples and slides for a talk I gave recently
at #wpldn. To view the slides please check out:
[http://talks.guyroutledge.co.uk/sass-compass/slides/](http://talks.guyroutledge.co.uk/sass-compass/slides/)

Code examples are linked throughout the slides or just have a browse
through the [scss
directory](https://github.com/guyroutledge/sass-compass-talk/tree/master/scss)
